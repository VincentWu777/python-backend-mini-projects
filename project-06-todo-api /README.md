# Todo API (With Status)

A FastAPI service that implements a Todo resource with explicit
state management.

This project focuses on modeling resource state, separating
content updates from state transitions, and designing clear,
RESTful APIs for real-world backend systems.

## Todo Model

Each Todo has the following fields:

- `id` (int): unique identifier generated by the service
- `title` (str): task description
- `completed` (bool): task state

The `completed` field represents the state of the Todo and is
managed exclusively by the system.

## Endpoints

### Create Todo
POST /todos

Request body:
```json
{
  "title": "Learn FastAPI"
}
A newly created Todo always starts with completed = false.

List Todos

GET /todos

Returns all Todos, including their current state.

Get Todo

GET /todos/{todo_id}

Returns a single Todo by ID.

Returns 404 Not Found if the Todo does not exist

Update Todo Content

PUT /todos/{todo_id}

Request body:

{
  "title": "Learn FastAPI deeply"
}


Updates the Todo title without modifying its state.

Complete Todo

PATCH /todos/{todo_id}/complete

Marks the Todo as completed.

This is a state transition, not a generic update

The operation is idempotent

Delete Todo

DELETE /todos/{todo_id}

Deletes the specified Todo.

Returns the deleted Todo

Returns 404 Not Found if the Todo does not exist

State Management Principles

State transitions are modeled as explicit actions

The client cannot directly set the completed field

Content updates and state changes use separate APIs

All state changes are controlled by the backend

Error Handling

Uses HTTP status codes to represent failure conditions

Returns 404 Not Found for non-existent resources

Maintains consistent error behavior across all endpoints
