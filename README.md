## 👋 About Me & This Repo
Hi, I'm **Vincent**.

I'm using this repository to **systematically learn Python backend development**, one small project at a time.

Rather than following tutorials passively, I learn by **building many focused backend projects**, each designed to practice a specific concept such as API design, database interaction, authentication, or backend infrastructure.

This repo intentionally shows the **progression**:
- from simple APIs
- to database-backed services
- to more realistic, production-style backend systems

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Master Python backend development through hands-on projects
- Build clean, readable, and maintainable APIs
- Gain practical experience with databases, authentication, and backend infrastructure
- Develop engineering habits aligned with Big Tech backend standards

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.10+
- **Frameworks**:
  - FastAPI (primary)
  - Django
  - Flask
- **Databases**:
  - SQLite
  - PostgreSQL
- **ORM / Data**:
  - SQLAlchemy
  - Django ORM
- **Auth & Security**:
  - JWT
  - API Key
- **Infrastructure & Tooling**:
  - Redis
  - Docker & Docker Compose
  - pytest
  - GitHub Actions (CI)
