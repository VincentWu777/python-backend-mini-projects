# In-Memory Users CRUD API

A FastAPI service that implements a complete CRUD (Create, Read,
Update, Delete) workflow for a User resource using in-memory
storage.

This project focuses on RESTful API design, resource identity,
and consistent error handling without introducing a database.

## User Model

Each user has the following fields:

- `id` (int): unique identifier generated by the service
- `name` (str)
- `email` (str)

The `id` is immutable and used as the primary resource identifier.

## Endpoints

### Create User
POST /users

Request body:
```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "alice@example.com"
}
```
List Users

GET /users

Returns all users currently stored in memory.

Get User

GET /users/{user_id}

Returns a single user by ID.

Returns 404 Not Found if the user does not exist

Update User

PUT /users/{user_id}

Request body:
```json
{
  "name": "Alice Updated",
  "email": "alice.updated@example.com"
}
```


Updates an existing user

Returns 404 Not Found if the user does not exist

Delete User

DELETE /users/{user_id}

Deletes the specified user

Returns the deleted user

Error Handling

Uses HTTP status codes to distinguish success and failure

Returns 404 Not Found for non-existent resources

Avoids returning error messages with 200 OK
